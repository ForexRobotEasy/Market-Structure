# Market Structure Forex Software

This code is a sample implementation of the Market Structure Forex Software, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to execute trades in the Forex market based on certain conditions and update trade information on a chart.

## Functionality

The code includes necessary libraries for trading and charting. It defines variables for tracking the last trade time, price, and volume, as well as variables for stop loss and take profit levels.

It initializes a trade object and chart objects for displaying trade information, stop loss, and take profit levels on the chart.

The `ExecuteTrade` function is responsible for executing trades. It takes the price, volume, and order type as parameters. It uses the `Buy` or `Sell` methods of the trade object to execute the trade with the specified parameters. If the trade is successful, it updates the last trade information. If the trade fails, it prints an error message.

The `UpdateTradeInfoOnChart` function updates the trade information text on the chart. It constructs a string with the last trade time, price, and volume and assigns it to the `tradeInfoText` object.

The `UpdateStopLossTakeProfitOnChart` function updates the stop loss and take profit levels text on the chart. It assigns the stop loss and take profit levels to the `stopLossText` and `takeProfitText` objects, respectively.

The `OnInit` function is called during the initialization of the code. It creates the chart objects for displaying trade information, stop loss, and take profit levels.

The `OnDeinit` function is called during the deinitialization of the code. It deletes the chart objects.

The `OnStart` function is the main entry point of the code. It sets the stop loss and take profit levels based on the current Ask price. It then executes a trade with a volume of 0.1 and a buy order type. After executing the trade, it updates the trade information and stop loss/take profit levels on the chart.
